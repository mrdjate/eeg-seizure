# eeg-seizure
This project started in December 2023. When I wanted, for medical and personal reasons, to undertand and build a minimal, reproducible baseline for labeled EEG seizure detection. It stayed on my machine for that long. In 2026, it was updated to a clean foundation for fast experimentation and clinical relevancy threshold tuning.
